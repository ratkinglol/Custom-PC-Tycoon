just a funny computer tycoon building game made in python

Please Note:
there are 4 different versions, the normal one with turtle, the normal one with just text, the folder with turtle and better performance, and the folder with just text but better performance

Also:
only 1 will work on pythonanywhere.com/python.org (vanilla python), it is the (No turtle, purely text based) file. NOT THE folder
